#  Overview
Inspired by the `Butler & butter`  website, Tails & Whiskers is an e-commerce website that enables pet lovers (cat & dog) to navigate and choose the type of food appropriate for their pet. 
This is the third project in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.
Working with three other colleagues (Arjun, Ineta  & Aya), we had 10 days to develop a full stack MERN application using an Express API to serve data from a Mongo database, and a separate front end built with React.


#  Brief & Timeframe

- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Have a visually impressive design.
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
- Timeframe: 8 days.
