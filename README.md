#  Overview
Inspired by the `Butler & butter`  website, Tails & Whiskers is an e-commerce website that enables pet lovers (cat & dog) to navigate and choose the type of food appropriate for their pet. 
This is the third project in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.
Working with three other colleagues (Arjun, Ineta  & Aya), we had 10 days to develop a full stack MERN application using an Express API to serve data from a Mongo database, and a separate front end built with React.
