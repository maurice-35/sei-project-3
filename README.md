#  Overview
Inspired by the `Butler & butter`  website, Tails & Whiskers is an e-commerce website that enables pet lovers (cat & dog) to navigate and choose the type of food appropriate for their pet. 
This is the third project in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.
Working with three other colleagues (Arjun, Ineta  & Aya), we had 10 days to develop a full stack MERN application using an Express API to serve data from a Mongo database, and a separate front end built with React.


#  Brief & Timeframe

- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Have a visually impressive design.
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
- Timeframe: 8 days.

#  Approach
General approach: We started by brainstorming on the type of project to build. We took each person‚Äôs idea of what can potentially be done, discussing in detail and voting on each element of the idea (from how challenging it would be to build the front and back end, to populating the database and the overall app). We selected the project idea with the highest score. We used agile methodology, and set up a Trello board to keep track of our work. We also had stand-ups every morning and communicated on Slack since we were working remotely. We had pair-coding sessions on Zoom and shared live screens. We found all these to be effective means of communication.
To better understand how our app would work at the fundamental level, we had to set out our models and functionality:
We structured the various models using Miro.com as shown below:
